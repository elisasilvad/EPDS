# The journey of Art

The purpose of *The journey of Art* project is to analyze how much an artwork moves before arriving to its current location. In this perspective, **provenance** is the watchword, as the definition term used to denote the history of ownership of an artwork from the time it is created until it is acquired or surrendered by an institution.
The focus is on the *Zeri Photo Archive*, availabe in Linked Open Data thanks to the Zeri & Lode Project,


This project was carried out by Marina Christodoulou (storytelling, communication, data manipulation, data visualization and graphics), Giulia Renda (data extraction, data organization, data manipulation, data visualization) and Elisa Silva (data manipulation, data visualization, storytelling, web development, graphics) for the **Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling** (a.y. 2020-2021) final exam, as part of the *Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge* Master's Degree at the University of Bologna.
