# The journey of Art

Broad and popular is the view that artworks have been, are and will always be in the place where we have connected them, as a milestone in history. In reality, an artwotk changes location even more than once in its life-time. All these journeys leave marks and traces in archives, catalogues and collections. The aim of *The journey of Art* project is to retrieve and explore them, to restore the essence of art as 'removable' .
In particular, we analyze how much an artwork moves before arriving to its current location. In this perspective, **provenance** is the watchword, as the definition term used to denote the history of ownership of an artwork from the time it is created until it is acquired or surrendered by an institution.
The *Zeri Photo Archive*, availabe in Linked Open Data thanks to the Zeri & Lode Project, is the main source of data.


This project was carried out by Marina Christodoulou (storytelling, communication, data manipulation, data visualization and graphics), Giulia Renda (data extraction, data organization, data manipulation, data visualization) and Elisa Silva (data manipulation, data visualization, storytelling, web development, graphics) for the **Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling** (a.y. 2020-2021) final exam, as part of the *Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge* Master's Degree at the University of Bologna.
