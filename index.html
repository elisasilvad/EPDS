                        questions that suddenly come to our mind are: where does it come from? What story is hidden

                    <p>Rarer is to wonder

                        . In how many parts of the world has it been to? What are the traces it had left in its passages?

                        there is so wide? In reality though, Leonardo's masterpiece landed in the Louvre only during
                        the period of the French Revolution, while before it had been sold to King Francis I for 4,000
                        gold coins. Even after the acquiring from the Louvre, it had been missing for two years, and

                        all the owners an artwork has had through the time. It allows to examine where it started its
                        journey, what were the halts on the route and where that expedition reached its end. Provenance
                        is therefore a litmus test for the journeys of an art piece, the <mark>passport</mark> in which all its
                        passages around the world are stamped.</p>

            <p>The big picture, which will reveal in a general but extremely important degree the expansion of Italian
                art specimens around the world, is their geographical location. It is important to understand that art
                cannot be limited to geographical borders, as a fact for the aforementioned and the intuitive aspect of
                the movement is that, despite their Italian origin a vast amount of them are being kept in foreign
                institutions. The map bellow demonstrates the number of Italian paintings that are

                the borders of Italy and their
                <mark>current location</mark>
                , while it proves, our initial speculation, the wide spread of Italian works of art, even in places
                where we would hardly think that we could find hints of it (e.g. Egypt).
            <p> According to the data presented in the map, about
                <mark>425 pieces</mark>
                of Italian artworks are located in <i>Europe</i>, with the exception of Italy as the predecessor, while

            <h3>STOP 2: CITIES</h3>
            <p>At an even more detailed level than the national one, art often travels from city to city. Addressing the
                problem of provenance from the point of view of cities allows us to also take into consideration all
                <mark>internal movements within the same country</mark>. Furthermore, we can introduce the concept of
                <mark>exchange of works of art</mark> and investigate their movements from the point of view of acquisitions and
                disposals by cities.</p>
            <p>Each city carries out a certain number of acts of exchange which, alone, are already able to restore the
                dimension of the art relocation:</p>

            <p>These exchanges can be mainly of two types: <mark>acquisitions and disposals of artworks</mark>. Cities around the world ditinguish for the quantity of exchanging acts performed:</p>

            <p>Of course cities are also places, and a larger sight on them allow to draw a sort of geography of art
                exchanges. Indeed, the most relevant cities for exchanging acts are placed along the two side of the
                Atlantic Ocean, drawing <mark>a very precise route of art movement</mark>. At the same time, some countries result to
                be completely outside from this route, eg. Asia and Africa. It is an almost totally Western-centric
                exchanging.</p>

            <h3>STOP 3: INSTITUTIONS</h3>
            <p>Nevertheless, the real protagonists of the exchange of works of art are the institutions. <mark>Museums, private
                collections and even auctions: art travels in different ways.</mark></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="chartdiv6" class="chartdiv"></div>
            <p style="font-size:15px; width:75%; text-align: right; margin-left:23%">As was to be expected, Italy turns
                out to be the largest exporter of Italian paintings due to the exchange acts of its institutions. Among
                the 20 that sell Italian paintings, there are as many as 12 Italian entities, public and private, with
                the absolute dominance on the market of the Private Collection, which stands out among all the others
                for the large amount of paintings sold over time.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="chartdiv5" class="chartdiv"></div>
            <p style="font-size:15px; width:75%; text-align: right; margin-left:23%">But the same thing can be said, about acquisitions as well. 10 Italian institutions are among the 20 largest acquirings of Italian art in the world, a data that returns the relevance of art movements happening within the same country.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>However, not all art trading institutions are created equal. Some of them are more focused on
                import, others on export. 
                <br>Nonetheless, a glance to the <mark>four most relevant ones</mark> returns how all the majors have been focused on acquisitions rather than disposals:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="chartdiv7" class="chartdiv"></div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, art exchanges allow us to reconsider the role of institutions as well. They are no longer atomic
                entities that gealously keep their treasures, but parts of a larger whole, building with their
                <mark>relationships</mark> a real network through which art is able to move and link the most different places in the
                world:</p>

            <h3>STOP 4: CHASING PAINTINGS</h3>
            <p>Throughout this expedition we explored the geographical location of Italian works of art on a global
                scale, their journey through the fabric of cities and the final position held by institutions in the
                process.
                We acquired important information about the way in which the active cultural network extends beyond the
                Atlantic as well as the influence of Italian art. 
                <br>In the last stop of our exploration we retrace the stages of the <mark>paintings that have traveled the world the most</mark> while looking at their passages overseas</p>
